## How to run

1. Go to file location after downloading and unzipping with cmd(Wnidows) and run command: composer update
2. After succesfully commited command run: composer install

3. Next you should make database and connect to it with your connection data. Code to make database is under folder dbMake. Under file .env you should have data for connecting to database:</br>
DB_CONNECTION=mysql</br>
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1</br>
DB_PORT=3306</br>
DB_DATABASE=homestead</br>
DB_USERNAME=homestead</br>
DB_PASSWORD=secret</br>
You have to edit this file with your connection to daatabase. Usualy you should to change:</br> 
DB_USERNAME= it should be the name of your created database. </br>
DB_USERNAME= username to connect to database(default root).</br>
DB_PASSWORD= pasword to connect to database(default there is no password so it's left blank for my setup).

## IMPORTANT
If app doesn't seem to be working, it's probably because .env file has something written after .env like(.example). If this happens to you you should delete .example and leave just .env.(.env.example to .env)
After that change, you should run this command in terminal.</br>
php artisan key:generate

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
